# BBVita-Mod-Tool

A tool that all beat banger mods have to be run through to make them playable on the ps vita 

## How to use (if it wasn't blatantly obvious already):

1: Extract the zip file

2: Run the exe üò±

3: Type in or copy the folder link to in the prompt, this can be acquired by going one layer outside a beat banger mod folder and clicking on the address bar. This should give you the location of the folder in which you can copy into the tool.

4: Watch the tool cycle through every mod in that folder. How long it takes depending on the mods size but most mods take about 1 second on my laptop

5: The mods should now have been converted into vita compatible mods ,just drag them onto your vita.


## (not) FAQ

### Will this ever have a build on Linux or Mac?

No

### The mod converter errors out and doesn't convert a mod , what should I do?

If you can get a screen recording of the error (should appear momentarily before the prompt closes) send it to me on discord or reddit so I can look into it.
Alternatively if you've used the mod on a release mod converter beforehand, reboot your pc before putting it through the tool as sometimes it still gets classed as being used by the converter.

### Can I put a mod through this tool multiple times?

Technically yes however at the cost of a mod looking like absolute piss üó£Ô∏è. Will make it so it doesn't run on mods it's been previously run on at some point
